Smart Money Smarts — Static Single-File Site
Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- student_finance_guide.md (this content summary)
- README.md (this file)

Purpose:
A single-page, responsive, dark-theme website tailored for Canadian students. The site uses anchors so it works as a single HTML file you can host or embed.

How to use with Google Sites
Option A — Host externally and embed (recommended)
1. Host these files on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.
   - Example: push to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages, or simply drag to Netlify.
2. In Google Sites, choose Insert → Embed → By URL and paste the public URL of index.html (e.g., https://your-username.github.io/repo/).
3. Google Sites will embed the page via an iframe. Resize the embed container to fit.

Option B — Embed raw HTML (limited)
- New Google Sites has limited support for raw HTML. If "Embed -> Embed code" accepts it, you can paste the contents of index.html there. Note: complex scripts or external assets may be blocked; hosting the file and embedding by URL is more reliable.

Customizing content
- Replace placeholder images with your own royalty-free images.
- Update the contact email (smartmoney@yourdomain.com).
- Update links in Resources to point to your Google Sheets, PDFs, or affiliate links.
- If you have a mailing provider (Mailchimp, ConvertKit), replace the mailto newsletter logic in script.js with their embed form action.

Accessibility & performance tips
- Keep images optimised (webp or compressed JPEG).
- Add alt text for any new images.
- When inserting affiliate links, add a clear disclosure in the footer and on sponsored content.

License & attribution
- This site template is provided for your use. Replace content as needed. Images used in the sample point to Unsplash; follow their license if you keep them.
